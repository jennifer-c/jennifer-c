Welcome to my profile! I'm a **Computer Science student at McMaster University**. 

- Previously, I've worked at **IBM** and **Morgan Stanley**.
- I'll be graduating in Spring 2022, so I'm actively looking for new grad roles!
- While I mainly have experience in backend Java development, data science in Python, and some web development work, I'm very open to learning new things, especially as someone just starting their career!
